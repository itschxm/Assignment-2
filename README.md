# Assignment-2

The assignment is to predict the closing stock market price. We used supervised machine learning with a regression algorithm to solve this. We  probably should have written a polynomial regression algorithm as well to see if it had higher accuracy than linear regression.

We chose this algorithm because itâ€™s used to predict values within a continuous range, rather than trying to classify them into categories. x represents our input data and y represents our prediction.
